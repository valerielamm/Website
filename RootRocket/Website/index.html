                    <p>
                        The nutrients in each Root Rocket™ includes endo and ectomycorrhizae fungi, soluble sea kelp, soluble yucca plant extract, beneficial bacteria and Horta-Sorbe Water Management Gel.The fungi and beneficial bacteria go to work instantly, creating a nutritious environment for plants. The fungi brings old soil to life by filling it with nitrogen and phosphorous, for plant roots to enjoy.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                         If your plant is hungry it will enjoy the organic matter like the sea kelp and yucca plant extract because they contain a lot of minerals that will stimulate root growth.

                        They also help soil retain moisture around the roots so they won't dry out quickly during times of drought. Best of all the Horta-Sorbe Water Management Gel absorbs up to 10 times its weight in water and provides plant roots with the necessary moisture if needed. Once your plant gets thirsty the gel will give it a beneficial drink.

                    <p>
                        Root Rocket™ ultimately helps give fresh nutrients to old soil in order to help a new plant quickly become established and prevents it from drying out.
